About Molding Software
Designing is essential to building a better and more cost-effective mold with shorter leadtimes.
A variety of software is available to help overcome the daily challenges faced with data, quoting, designing and programmingâ€”including computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and data management software. CAM is used to generate machining programs corresponding to part designs; CAD is used for detailed engineering of 3-D models and/or 2-D drawings.
